You must write a class called Foo that has a property called x that is initialized according to these rules:

The initial value of x is zero when the Foo class is created.
When setting x to a number:
If the number is non-negative, the two digits on the right side of it are stored in x.
If the number is negative, the value of x will be equal to -1.
The value stored in x must be of type int.
