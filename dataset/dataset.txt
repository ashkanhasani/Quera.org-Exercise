in a database
   
A binary string n in length
ℓ
ℓ has been saved. We have also attributed Y or N to each of these fields.

now to you
   
A binary string of length q
ℓ
ℓ is given and we ask you to check which is Y or N. If a string does not exist in the dataset, we output the string Unknown.

Entrance
In the first line, enter three integers
   
n and
   
q and

ℓ separated by a space.



At
   
Next n lines, each line a string long
ℓ
You are given ℓ of 0 and 1 characters followed by one of Y and N characters followed by a space.

Guaranteed no two of these
   
n strings are not equal.

At
   
q Next line, each line a string long
ℓ
You are given ℓ of characters 0 and 1.
output
output has q lines and in each line, print the character corresponding to the string and if this string in it
   
n The string was missing, print Unknown.
