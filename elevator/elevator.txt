Saad and Hamad, who are roommates in a dormitory; They take the elevator from the ground floor to go to the floor where their room is located. But when they get on the elevator; They decide to play an exciting game!

Their dormitory elevator has only up and down buttons, the up button takes the elevator to a higher floor and the down button takes the elevator to a lower floor.

The game is such that these two people have 4 times to press the down and up button of this elevator. Finally, after pressing the up and down buttons of the elevator 4 times; They must understand which floor they are on.
We assume that we also have negative floors and the elevator, up to 4 floors, will also go underground.

Now, complete the calculate_floor function in such a way that by taking a 4-letter string that includes U meaning going to the upper floor and D meaning going to the lower floor, it will return the number of the floor to which we will finally go.

Pay attention that at the beginning of the movement, we are on the ground floor (number 0).
