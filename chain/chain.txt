In this exercise,
you should design a class called Chain so that it has the following behaviors:
Chain addition of numbers
When one or more numbers (both integers and decimals) are passed as parameters to the class, the output must be a sum of the input numbers.
Also, the objects themselves must be equal to the output value.
Concatenation of strings
When one or more concatenated strings are passed as parameters to the class, the output must be a string concatenating the input strings with a space character (as a separator).
Also, the objects themselves must be equal to the output value.
Other modes
In the following two cases, an exception with invalid operation message must be thrown:
One or more strings and numbers are sent as parameters to the class at the same time.
Any parameter that is not a string or number should be sent to the class.
